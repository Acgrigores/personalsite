            <img id = "profile-pic" src="assets/me.png" alt="Anna Grigorescu">
            <p>Hello! I'm Anna Grigorescu, a senior at Evanston Township High School 
                who will be studying Computer Science at Northwestern or UIUC in the fall.</p>

            <p>Beyond the classroom, I enjoy participating in coding clubs, hackathons, and
                 other organizations such as ETHSâ€™ Animal Welfare Club and Scholastic Bowl 
                 Team. These experiences have not only advanced by technical abilities but 
                 also taught me perseverance, leadership, prganization, and communication.</p>
            <p>As I further my education, I also look forward to opportunities to using my
                 skills and passions to make a positive impact in the tech world.</p>

                 support students and staff with their Chromebook computers, checked in/out loaners
                  and customer devices coming in/out of repair, and diagnosed and performed troubleshooting
                  on out-of-warranty Chromebooks, and performed technical repairs through software
                updates and replacement of major parts including batteries, screens, keyboards, motherboards,

            <h2>Loyola University Chicago Software Systems Laboratory Intern (June 2022-August 2022)</h2>
            <p> In this position, I worked in Flask, HTML, CSS, and JS to build the frontend to a tool that 
                allows users to test the efficiency of their computer vision software on low-powered machines,
                 assisted in a (now published) research paper about the risks of open-source machine learning
                model hubs, and helped assemble a 3d printing lab.

            <h2>ETHS EMERGE Leadership Development Program</h2>
            <p> My freshman year, I created a climate curriculum taught to 3,700 students so far. Sophomore year, I 
                facilitated a collaboration between local school gardens and Evanston Grows (a local food insecurity
                 organization), and I acted as the co-chair of the outreach committee in grades 11 and 12.
